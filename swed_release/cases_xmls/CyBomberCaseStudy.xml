	<para></para>
	<para>The country of Malevolentia is attacking cities in the country of Homelandia with missiles.  Homelandia's conventional weapons are unable to defend against the missiles.  Homelandia tried to negotiate a peace settlement but Malevolentia refused to negotiate.  The Warfare Systems Corp. of Homelandia recently created CyBomber, an autonomous cyberweapon that can shoot down missiles.  It has never been tested in an actual war. In desperation, Homelandia decides to deploy CyBomber against Malevolentia's missiles.

	<para>News reports start coming in that CyBomber is destroying hospitals in Malevolentia, a serious violation of international law.  CyBomber was not designed to attack targets on the ground and its actions are completely inexplicable. In a panic, the WSC developers try to disable CyBomber.  They are not successful.
